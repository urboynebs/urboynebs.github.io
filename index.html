    <h2>To:
        My beloved, George.</h2>
    <p>
         It all began when I first saw you in the election for the HUMSS club, you were nominated to be the club president. The very moment I laid my eyes on you, I knew something about you was different. I can't exactly tell what it is, but it's something, something I never felt before. After the election, my good friend and I went straight to class so as not to miss any lessons. After that—I never really thought about it much. It became something that lingers in the back of my mind, which was weird because I often forget about things regularly. We often pass by each other while we're on our way to our next classes—not knowing that we will share something so significant in the future. I admired you quietly for months, no one knew I liked you, only me. But I did tell some of my friends that I have my eyes on someone a year younger than me. They kept on insisting that I tell them who it is, but of course, I refused to tell them. A few months had passed since I had admired you, it was a Saturday afternoon, March 1 to be specific. I was scrolling through my Facebook newsfeed when a friend suggestion suddenly popped up, and of course, it's you. After all those months of admiring you I never really knew your name, not that I even bothered to. So after a few stressful scenes that I simulated on this head of mine, I decided to send you a friend request. Best believe I was in shock when you accepted it only a few moments later. I rejoiced at that very moment, I didn't know why, but I was happy, grateful even. After that, I remembered that upcoming SHS prom on the 7th of March, and since it's my last year as a high school student, I decided that I wanted to dance with you at the prom. The only problem was that I didn't know if you're also into guys, I could only hope—or at least reason out with you that the dance doesn't have to mean anything, just a dance and nothing else. Monday came, March 3, I started to construct a plan on how to approach you and ask you to dance, but then, my classmates called all the students to practice for the prom, before I left our room I saw another friend of mine sitting beside the teachers table waiting for my adviser to arrive—I told her about my "crush" which was you and imagine my shock when I saw you sitting beside my chair as I was about to leave. I couldn't believe it so I just randomly pulled one of my classmates and told her that you were the one I was admiring for quite some time. She looked at me with her eyes that stated what she was about to do was completely irrational so I pulled her out of the building and told her that we're late for the practice.

      <p>
       That was when everything began, the day I realized that you're the one I wanted to pursue, the one I wanted to spend the rest of my life with. A friend of mine introduced me to you, and I'm pretty sure you know who she is, and she's also the one who served as a catalyst for a love that was yet to bloom. After a few words of encouragement from her, I decided to finally ask you to dance at the prom. I was nervous at first, mooo, as I'm worried that my sudden invite would only drift me away from you. After a few minutes that felt like hours, my friend called me as she was laughing hysterically. She told me that you agreed to dance with me—I couldn't contain my joy at that moment so I accidentally hit one of my classmates in the head. A few days before the prom, my friend insisted that we should talk first so as not to feel awkward and shocked on the day of the prom. I agreed with her and told her to help me get in contact with you, After a few minutes of arguing on who should reach out first, you sent me a message. It was that message that paved the way to everything that was yet to happen. We got to know each other a little bit before prom and I think that helped to reduce awkwardness. The day of the prom came, and I was nervous and excited because after a few months of silently admiring you, I finally got to dance with you. A few moments after I arrived, a friend of mine called me to tell me that the gift I made for you, which I had them help with, was on their table, and they told me to take it and give it to you, and so I did. I approached you at the stage and gave you the gift I had prepared for you. After that, I went on my way to enjoy the evening with my friends, and after a while, another friend of mine told me that you were looking for me. I went on my way to find you and I saw near the table that was designated for your section. You saw me approaching, so you started walking towards me, and we danced. It lasted for a few minutes, but it only felt like a fraction of a second. A shame. I would've danced with you as long as you wanted if we had the time. It was that dance that brought me to you, and for the rest of our story, it's something that I'll keep to myself. Something only we and our friends will know, and a few of our teachers of course. :>

        Things may not have gone well which led our story to end, but a part of me still hopes that there's still a future that's waiting for us, and no matter how long I have to wait— I will, if it means that someday, everything will be like how they used to be. You're the only one who made me feel this way, a feeling that brings me peace and joy amidst a chaotic world in which we live. You're presence brings me warmth and comfort, something no one else could, and even if the time comes and I start to feel that it longer doesn't, I promise you that there's nothing for you to worry about, because no matter how hard it gets—my heart will always find it's way back to you. My heart belongs to you, and it always will be. That means whatever happens between us, I will always be there for you, my one and only. May your travel without me be safe and prosperous. I love you, my one and only.
